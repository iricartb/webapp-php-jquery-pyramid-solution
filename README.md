Alejandro Ricart Cab√∫s - The construction of the Great Pyramid. Constructive solution on how the pyramids of Egypt were built. ISBN 978-84-611-7106-4.<br><br>
The construction of the great pyramids of Egypt is an unsolved issue in a satisfactory way and as Georges Goyon confesses, it constitutes one of the most irritating problems in Egyptian archeology [GOYON, 1990, p.15].<br><br>
Jean kerisel makes a very accurate diagnosis when he says that all attempts to explain the construction of the Great Pyramid can be classified into two mutually exclusive groups or families: the defenders of the inclined plane or ramp (1-1), and the supporter of the machines (1-2), being more likely that the solution lies in a combination of both systems [KERISEL, 1991, p.81].<br><br>
